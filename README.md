## Rockmuser

Welcome to Rockmuser! Rockmuser is an app that seeks to solve the issue of social media sites not connecting bands and musicians to their fans in an efficient manner. Users in Rockmuser sign up for either musician or fan accounts. Users may post musings which stay on their profile page much like a "wall" or they may post articles which appear in everyone's "feed". Fan accounts may browse and follow musician accounts but musician accounts may only see the fans that connect to them. However, musicians may also set a profile video (as a YouTube embed). Users may also log in and log out as well as upload profile photos using Active Storage via AWS.
